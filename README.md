Ece's solutions for Advent of Code 2023

### Execution instructions for TypeScript

- Install `typescript`, `ts-node`, `@types/node` packages globally by running `npm install typescript ts-node @types/node -g`
- cd into `/solutions/typescript`
- Execute the run script from the command line with --day, --part, and --test flags `./run.sh --day 1 --part 1`

### Execution instructions for Go

- Install go
- cd into `/solutions/go`
- Execute the run script from the command line with --day, --part, and --test flags `./run.sh --day 1 --part 1`

# Notes

- I write in go first and typescript after, so the typescript version is slightly more cleaned up.
- I do not use chatgpt and I implement the first solution that comes to mind. So these might not be the most elegant.
